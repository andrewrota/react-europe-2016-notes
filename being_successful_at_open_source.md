Being Successful at Open Source by (Christopher Chedeau)[https://twitter.com/vjeux]

FB only open sources projects used in production

Open Source: the beginning.

* Strip out dependencies
* Make a good website
* Streamline the getting started experience
* Announce the library with a blog post

But then you still have zero users.  Now you need to go from 0 to a lot of users.

Where do you engage with the community?  There are many options for platforms, but it doesn't matter.  These platforms are just tools.  Pick one or two, and make sure you're there.

Two questions to everyone that uses your library:
  - **What did you struggle with?** (What went wrong with using react, etc.)  Say it in a negative way, so you don't just get feature requests and suggestions which may or may not be useful.  If you ask what they struggle with then you find out what the bug is.  **User knows best what is broken, core team knows best how to fix it**
  - **What cool stuff are you building with the library?**  One surprising thing is that people don't expect this question and they're surprised because they're not used to being asked what they're actually working on.  You show that you care about your users.  There's a human link between you and your users.

Improve error messages so users don't hit road blocks.

Demos are not useful just for promotion, they're also useful for meetings.  Ask everyone in meetings to prepare a demo of what they're working on.  Also, see powermode in Atom!

**D**emo **D**riven **D**evelopment: ask someone to write a blog post about what they're working on.  Blog posts are a developer's currency.

Write community roundups to highlight community work.  Makes the community feel active.  Shifts perception and is helpful at the beginning of your project.  Perception becomes reality.

External praises are much more impactful instead of whatever's internal.

**In conclusion: be out there and talk to people, find out about issues and fix then, and promote your users projects.**
