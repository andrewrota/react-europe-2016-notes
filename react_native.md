React Native Retrospective by [Bonnie Eisenman](https://twitter.com/brindelle)

In 2014 (year before react native), mobile time spent on screens over took time spent on desktop.

But mobile development is hard:

* Platform specific arcana
* Siloed knowledge
* Re-build all the things

When an iOS dev and an Android dev can't collaborate that closely... :(

But the alternatives were not super great.

Zuckerberg: "The biggest mistake we've made as a company is betting on HTML5 over native."  At the time, at least, mobile web really wasn't there.

Skip ahead to React Conf Jan. 2015.

The vision articulated with React Native is that you can "Learn once, write anywhere".  You can write JS for iOS and Android, with native-level performance.

Feels like web development, but targeting a different platform.

Lots of excitement with the alpha release at React Conf.

Skip ahead to public release in March 2015.

Skip ahead six months to September 2015.

People writing about their actual experiences working with it React Native.

People start to take react native seriously.  it's being used in production.

Android release in September 2015 as well.

When you work with React Native you can accidently write cross-platform code.  Drives home the fact that React Native, much like React, pushes you in a general direction and makes it easier to write code in certain ways.

Skip ahead to present day.

React Native has evolved in a huge number of ways.  Microsoft and Samsung devices support React Native.  Rough edges are slowly getting sanded down and fixed.

React native is more than just react or native.  it's a lingua franca api layer that helps us target all these platforms with javascript.
