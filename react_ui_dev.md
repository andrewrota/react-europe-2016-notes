The Evolution of React UI Development by [Max Stoiber](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) and [Nik Graf](https://twitter.com/nikgraf)

Components: markup + logic + style.  React executed components right.

First major improvement in UI development was live reload

Hot reloading changed everything...again.

Webpack: incredibly powerful and incredibly complex.  Built a plugin system on top of webpack's plugin system.  Build a small app to try this out.  Releasing tool called "Carte Blanche".  Component generator with random data based on prop types.  The goal is to fix bugs and persist variations created.  Whenever you create a variation a file is created that matches your component path.
